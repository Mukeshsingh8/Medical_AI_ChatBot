4 EXPERIMENTAL  RESULTS  
Three different outputs are shown where the disease is identified 
from the present symptoms and other related symptoms are given 
from the AI based chatbot system.  
Our system identifies the diseases and other related symptoms 
with given disease once the patient identifies and says “yes” for the 
present symptom. The fact that it provides not only the disease, but 
also other common symptoms make it different from the other 
projects of this kind.
